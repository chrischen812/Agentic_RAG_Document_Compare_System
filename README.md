# Overview

This is a fully operational Intelligent Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System built with FastAPI and LangGraph. The system provides advanced document classification, ontological mapping, and comparative analysis capabilities for PDF documents. It uses AI agents to perform multi-step reasoning for intelligent document retrieval, analysis, and cross-document comparison.

The system integrates multiple AI services and frameworks to create a comprehensive document intelligence platform that can understand, classify, and analyze documents across healthcare Benefits domain while maintaining semantic relationships through ontological structures.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the main directory:

```env
# Required
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

```


## Development Environment using Python native Virtual Machine 

1. **Setup and activate Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment
   python -m venv venv

   # Activate and you should see '(venv)'
   source venv/Scripts/activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to Backend ## Deployment using local Virtual Machine (venv)folder
   ./setup.sh
   ```

3. **Set environment variables:**
   ```bash
   # The "GEMINI_API_KEY" is automatically loaded into the environment from the .env file via python-dotenv, so manual declaration is not required.
   ```

4. **Run the server:**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the folder containing main.py
   uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000 --reload
   ```

5. **Close out the server and Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   # Ctrl + C to terminate API, and run the following in base to terminate virtual envorment
   deactivate

   # Remove 'venv' folder under project
   rm -rf venv/
   ```



## Development Environment using Docker, refer to the "Docker" folder README

1. **Start development container:**
   ```bash
   cd docker
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
   ```

2. **Access the application:**
   - API: http://localhost:5000
   - Documentation: http://localhost:5000/docs
